# SimpleLinearRegressionTensorflow-JS
## Project Objective

The goal of this project is to perform simple linear regression to train a model to make predictions from numerical data describing a set of cars using TensorFlow.js

## Project Components

Our project consists of 4 sections: The first includes _Horsepower v MPG_ chart (Original Data), the second includes _Model Summary_ table , the third includes _Training Performance_ 
with 2 charts: _loss_ and _mse(Mean Squared Error)_ and the last includes _Model Predictions vs Original Data_ chart

## Technologies used

- HTML
- TensorFlow.js

## Development environment

- IDE: VS Code

## Procedures

1. Create an HTML file called _index.html_
2. Import _TensorFlow.js_ by adding ```<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@tensorflow/tfjs@2.0.0/dist/tf.min.js"></script>``` in _index.html_ inside ```<head>``` tag
3. Import _tfjs-vis_ by adding ```<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@tensorflow/tfjs-vis@1.0.2/dist/tfjs-vis.umd.min.js"></script>``` in _index.html_ inside ```<head>``` tag
4. Import the main script file which contains our logic by adding ```<script src="script.js"></script>``` in _index.html_ inside ```<body>``` tag
5. Run the application and the output should appear as follows:
